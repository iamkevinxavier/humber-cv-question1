# Basic Image Processing with Scikit-image

# Image Processing with Scikit-image

This Colab notebook provides a hands-on introduction to fundamental image processing techniques using the powerful Scikit-image library in Python. It covers essential concepts and demonstrates how to manipulate and analyze images within the Colab environment.

## Key Features

The notebook showcases the following image processing operations:

- **Image Loading and Display:**
  - Utilizes `io.imread()` to load an image into the notebook.
  - Employs `io.imshow()` and `plt.show()` to display images for visualization.
- **Color Channel Manipulation:**
  - Isolates and displays individual color channels (red, green, blue) of an image.
  - Demonstrates techniques for extracting and manipulating color information.
- **Grayscale Conversion:**
  - Transforms color images into grayscale representations using `color.rgb2gray()`.
  - Enables analysis and processing based on intensity values.
- **Otsu's Thresholding:**
  - Applies Otsu's method (`threshold_otsu()`) to automatically determine an optimal threshold value for image segmentation.
  - Generates binary images by classifying pixels as foreground or background based on the threshold.
- **Image Thresholding:**
  - Creates binary images using a global threshold determined by Otsu's method.
  - Illustrates the process of separating objects from the background.
- **Inverted Thresholding:**
  - Demonstrates inverting the binary image to highlight different features.
- **Visualization:**
  - Presents a comprehensive visualization of the original and processed images using Matplotlib.
  - Arranges images in a grid layout for easy comparison.

## Libraries Used

The notebook leverages the following essential libraries:

- **Scikit-image:** A comprehensive library for image processing, providing a wide range of algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib:** A versatile plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy:** The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, offering powerful array manipulation capabilities.

## Getting Started
